## Namespace and Overlay Volumes demos

### Process Namespaces

    docker run -it busybox
    ps -elf
    top

Execute **ps aufx** within another terminal window

### UID Namespace

Start a new container with

    docker run -it -v /:/host busybox`

Execute `whoami`

Explore /etc/passwd, /host/etc/passwd, /host/etc/shadow

Start container with the root process running as current UID

    docker run -u $UID -it -v /:/host busybox`

### Mount Point Namespaces

Execute **ls -lR** within a busybox container. Display file system mounts.

Touch a file in the container, find the file in host file system with

    sudo find / -name Waldo -print

Display the `diff` and `merged` version of the volume

### Overlay File System

* Run two busybox images
* Create a new file in each container, find it in the host file system
* Show that they donâ€™t see each other
* Remove **/bin/tee** in a busybox image
* Show the whiteout file in top layer

Also

* Inspect layers with `docker container inspect name` and `docker history`

### Build a New Image
